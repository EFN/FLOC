"Free Libre Open Campaigning is a wordplay on Free Libre Open Source Software "
"(FLOSS) it is a set of principles to obey by in order to better collaborate "
"on projects across countries. These principles are not limited to "
"campaigning, and can be used for any project where you would like to develop "
"once and run many, another word is Free Libre Open Collaboration."

"We are NGOs spread across Europe. When doing local campaigns we often need "
"to do translations and local adaptations. Especially when a campaign is "
"highgly stylized and made in inaccessiable formats this is not necessarily "
"easy, and almost the whole campaign has to be remade in each and every "
"country."

"Do yourselves what you like others to do to you. While this probably will "
"cost you a lot more time the first time you do it, and a little more time "
"the next times. The benefit comes from the fact that if others do this for "
"just one campaign, you've probably saved everything and then some."
